KD_comm_exercise
================
The application has to main modules: comm.erl and profile.erl
comm.erl is responsible for the server part and also works as kind of a user interface.
profile.erl is responsible for the client part. Each new user is a new proccess which spins in a loop until stopped.

There is a main app mylib_app.erl that is responsible for the start and stop of the application.

There are also 2 supperisors(mylib_supp.erl and profile_sup.erl) that restart the server/profiles if they are stopped prematurely.

avaiable functions:
-----------------------------
mylib_app:start(_StartType, _StartArgs) -> {ok, _Pid}

Argumets don't matter, starts the application, 
return: 
Pid - comm supervisour pid.
